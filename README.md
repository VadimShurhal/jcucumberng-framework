# jCucumberNG-Framework

## Overview
Allows automation testers to write feature/gherkin files for Cucumber and implement step definitions in basic Java classes. ngWebDriver (Protractor) offers extended support for Angular/JS web applications.

## Write Tests, Not Page Objects
[ [Skip](#the-framework) ]

### An Analogy
Like arithmetic, there are many ways to arrive to the same answer. Some longer, some shorter.

Page Object Model (POM) is like this:
~~~
[(2 + 2) * 3 - 7] / 1 = 5
~~~

Dependency Injection (DI) is like this:
~~~
2 + 3 = 5
~~~

### POM and BDD
An anti-pattern occurs when adhering to the design becomes the larger chore of automation efforts instead of writing sensible tests which is the common pitfall of the popular [Page Object Model](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/06_test_design_considerations.jsp#page-object-design-pattern). The priority becomes sustaining the design pattern, not _testing_. Automation testers find themselves spending more time overengineering page objects than writing high quality tests that provide actual value.

Why then, is POM a pervasive design pattern seen in many test automation suites? Tradition. This comes from the days of "pure" Selenium tests that do not offer [behavior-driven (BDD)](https://dzone.com/articles/the-basics-of-bdd-in-testing) or step-based capabilities. Add that to the fact that Selenium actively promotes the pattern and comes with `PageFactory` to support it, automation testers simply incorporated it to their BDD test frameworks by default and not by design.

> **TL;DR:**
>
> POM and BDD do not mix.

### Cucumber and DI
Cucumber inherently calls steps to move from one state to the next so mapping the user journey by [returning page objects](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) within step definitions does not make much sense. [PicoContainer](https://docs.cucumber.io/cucumber/state/#dependency-injection) (developed by [Aslak HellesÃ¸y](https://twitter.com/aslak_hellesoy)) eliminates the tight coupling of page objects to step definitions by sharing states in the glue code using [Dependency Injection](http://picocontainer.com/injection.html). It requires minimal configuration and injects the needed classes via the constructor. With shared objects, each step definition becomes an autonomous unit as is the nature of a Java method. The current step does not need to know the step before or after (loose coupling) making it much reusable.

In fact, there is no mention of POM in [The Cucumber for Java Book](https://pragprog.com/book/srjcuc/the-cucumber-for-java-book) but there is _Chapter 11: Simplifying Design with Dependency Injection_. The no-frills design allows for a faster return on investment (ROI) and a compact codebase to maintain in the long haul.

> **TL;DR:**
>
> - Selenium WebDriver + POM = OK
>
> - Selenium WebDriver + Cucumber + POM = Not OK
>
> - Selenium WebDriver + Cucumber + DI = ROI (fast and simple)

### The Framework
**jCucumberNG-Framework** deliberately foregoes the added complexity and maintenance overhead of POM to take advantage of Cucumber's intended design - to build a library of loosely coupled steps which can be independently called anywhere. Selenium WebDriver automates browser actions as it is supposed to. Writing new feature files means reusing and combining steps in the proper order. That's it!

## How It Works
The code below shows writing test scripts directly into step definitions because why not?

### ui-map.properties:
~~~
net.per.month=binding:roundDown(monthlyNet())
~~~

### Gherkin Syntax:
~~~
Then I Should See Net Income Per Month: 23769
~~~

### Step Definition:
~~~
private Selenium selenium = null; // Extended Selenium API

// PicoContainer injects ScenarioHook object
public NetIncomeProjectorSteps(ScenarioHook scenarioHook) { // ScenarioHook instantiates Selenium object
    selenium = scenarioHook.getSelenium();
}

@Then("I Should See Net Income Per Month: {word}")
public void I_Should_See_Net_Income_Per_Month(String expected) throws Throwable {
    WebElement netPerMonth = selenium.getVisibleElement("net.per.month"); // Use injected Selenium object
    String actual = netPerMonth.getText();
    Assertions.assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);
    LOGGER.debug("Net Per Month=" + actual);
}
~~~

[User Interface (UI) Mapping](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/06_test_design_considerations.jsp#user-interface-mapping) complements DI and is a known approach for keeping web elements in a single file. The `WebDriver` is not exposed while containing everything within the method in plain sight.

No need to plow through **76** page objects. Based on a true story.

## Prerequisites
- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) or higher
- [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) / [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) / [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) (recommended, includes Git for Windows)

## Getting Started
Visit the application under test (AUT) here: http://simplydo.com/projector/

No further configurations needed at this point. The tests will run against the AUT in [headless browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser) mode using ChromeDriver as defined in `framework.properties`.

### Test Execution
Run the following commands in the cmdline:
~~~
$ cd /path/to/workspace/
$ git clone <repo-url>
$ cd jcucumberng-framework/
$ mvn verify
~~~

Maven performs a one-time download of all dependencies for the first run. Execute `mvn verify` again after the downloads complete to begin test execution.

![mvn_verify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28589393/44941160-b6ff8c00-adca-11e8-9e10-5ad2949c6ee9.gif)

Test artefacts are created in the `/target/` directory after the build is successful.

### Reporting
HTML reports are generated with dynamic visuals and statistics.

#### [Allure Test Report](https://github.com/allure-framework)
Choose a method to produce the report.

**Method 1:** Generate report into temp folder and start web server (opens browser):
~~~
mvn allure:serve
~~~

**Method 2:** Generate report into directory: `/target/site/allure-maven-plugin/`
~~~
mvn allure:report
~~~

**Output:**

<!-- insert demo gif -->

### Logging
Logs are written to a daily rolling file. Executions from the previous day are saved with a datestamp.
